# Algo-A-Day

## A collection of Algorithms both exotic and mundane.

### This repository is an exploration of algorithms, many common, some perhaps not as common.
It is open for anyone to use, borrow, or fork.

Algorithms are currently being provided in JavaScript but I may add a Python folder at a later date.
Each algorithm has its own file named after the algorithm, which are grouped into folders by type.
For example radix sort can be found in the folder named "Sorting-Digit" because it sorts based on the place value of each digit. 

If you would like to make a recommendation of an algorithm to add please send me a message!
