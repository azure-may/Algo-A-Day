# Algo-A-Day

## A collection of Algorithms both exotic and mundane.

### This repository is an exploration of algorithms, many common, some perhaps not as common.
It is inspired by the \#100daychallenge
and is open for anyone to use, borrow, or fork.

Algorithms are currently being provided in JavaScript but I may add a Python folder at a later date.

If you would like to make a recommendation of an algorithm to add please send me a message!
